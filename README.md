# Portfolio V2

## Overview
Portfolio V2 is a revamped version of my original developer portfolio.  
The original portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This version modernises the same portfolio by rebuilding it with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The focus of this project is on improving maintainability, scalability, and overall code structure while keeping the original layout and content intact.
